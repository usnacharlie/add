## User Experience Improvements

### Member Portal:
- Members can see their Voter's ID prominently
- Cannot edit Voter's ID or NRC (admin only)
- Clear visual hierarchy of information
- Professional card design with all details

### Admin Interface:

- Required field indicators
- Easy to spot which members have temporary IDs (TEMP-XXXXXX)
- Edit form includes validation

### Registration:
- Clear, step-by-step form
- Voter's ID required before submission
- Helpful tooltips and hints
- Modern, professional design

---

## Database Status

### Current State:
- ✅ `voters_id` column: `nullable=False, unique=True`
- ✅ All existing members migrated with temporary IDs (TEMP-000001, etc.)
- ✅ New registrations require real voter IDs
- ✅ USSD service captures voter IDs correctly

### Migration Complete:
```
10 members migrated:
- TEMP-000001 through TEMP-000010
- These should be updated with real Voter IDs
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Update Temporary IDs**: Use the admin edit interface to replace TEMP-XXXXXX with actual voter IDs
2. **Train Staff**: Ensure data entry staff understand voter ID is mandatory
3. **USSD Testing**: Verify USSD registration captures voter IDs correctly
4. **Monitor Duplicates**: Watch for duplicate voter ID errors in logs

## Technical Notes

### Template Variables Required:
All member templates expect these variables:
- `member` - Member object with all fields
- `member.voters_id` - Required field (string)
- `member.nrc` - Optional field (string or None)
- `member.date_of_birth` - Date or string
- `member.ward_id` - Integer
- Location names (ward_name, constituency_name, district_name, province_name) where applicable

### API Endpoints Used:
- `GET /api/v1/members/{id}` - Returns voter_id in response
- `POST /api/v1/members/` - Requires voter_id in request body
- `PUT /api/v1/members/{id}` - Validates voter_id uniqueness on update
